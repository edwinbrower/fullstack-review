#fullstack-review
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

To setup: 

Add Github token in githubToken.js in the Server folder

Run npm install and then these the 3 starter scripts:

npm run react-dev

npm run server-dev

npm run db-start (if this does not work, just run mongod)

Go to: localhost:1128
